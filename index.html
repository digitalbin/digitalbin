Many educational efforts were done here i.e. hosting various meetups and organizing monthly workshops where we got to explore bleeding edge web tech.</p><br>&gt; <p>This gave me an understanding of the vastness of web development and a chance to dip my toes in numerous tools and strategies that one can adapt early on in my career.</p></article><article data-label="exp." data-order="4" data-name="hyper island">&gt; <h1>Hyper Island</h1><br>&gt; <h2>2014 - 2016</h2><br>&gt; <p>While I attended the Digital Data Strategy program I was first introduced to web development which caught my interest completely. So much so that I focused almost exclusively on javascript and ignored the digital data stuff I was supposed to learn.</p><br>&gt; <p>I have since then returned to Hyper Island as a guest lecturer for the Frontend Developer program.</p><br></article><article data-label="project" data-order="5" data-name="gröna linjen">&gt; <h1>Gröna Linjen Bryggeri</h1><br>&gt; <h2>A brewery based in Stockholm</h2><br>&gt; <p>…known for slingin’ the illest IPAs in town. </p><br>&gt; <p>This page was built with SvelteKit and Notion as a CMS.
